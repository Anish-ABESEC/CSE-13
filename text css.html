    <h1>Text Styling with CSS</h1>

    <p>
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to control the appearance and layout of web pages. It defines how HTML elements are displayed, including colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, and positioning. CSS helps separate content from design, making websites easier to maintain and update. It improves user experience by creating visually appealing and responsive layouts. CSS can be applied using inline, internal, or external styles and allows consistent styling across multiple web pages efficiently.
